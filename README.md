# Smart-Lighting-System
The idea of the project is when there's someone entering the house an IR
sensor senses the person that is entering the house and sends a signal to a light sensor that
lights up the white LED. And when someone exits the house the LED light turns off. The whole purpose of the project is to decrease power consumption.
